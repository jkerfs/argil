# argil

A simple modeling library designed primarily for crowd and robot simulations in Python.

## Overview
### Project Goals:

1. straightforward interface and API
2. flexible visualization and data collection
3. contrib modules for crowd, geometry, robot algorithm primitives

### Current Producers

- d3 (https://d3js.org/)
- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
- pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Current Simulators

- RecordSimulation (records are used by producers)
- PygameSimulation (real-time visualization of the simulation)
